3,Mathematics Chapter 3,Mathematics,,Mr. Ko
```
- The program will only use input.csv under the root directory as input. A sample working file has been provided in the root directory
- The program will read from the file and log the output as text in the console that it is run on. There is no user interaction required in the program
- The program only accepts numeric on the first column as input
- The program only accepts alphanumeric string on the second column as input
- The program only accepts alphanumeric string on the third column as input
- The program only accepts image url strings in the fourth column as input (Can be left empty)
- The program only accepts alphanumeric string on the third column as input

## Design Decisions
- Input are in csv instead of plaintext as it is more easily readable by a person in case of large quantities of data (Read as excel format). Also allows for easier parsing of data format
